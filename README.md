# Nathan Louissiant - SEO & Digital Marketing Strategy Portfolio

A futuristic, high-conversion portfolio built for an Enterprise SEO professional. Repositioned as a "Full-Stack SEO Strategist" using direct, outcome-first messaging and a cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React 18
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN for rapid deployment)
- **Deployment:** Optimized for GitHub Pages

## Deployment Steps (GitHub Pages)

Since this project uses modern React without a build step in this specific environment:

1.  **Create a Repository:** Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `nathan-seo-portfolio`).
2.  **Upload Files:** Push all generated files (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, `data.ts`, etc.) to the `main` branch.
3.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4.  **SEO Check:** Ensure the `metadata.json` and meta tags in `index.html` are customized with your target keywords (Enterprise SEO, Digital Marketing Austin, etc.).

## Content Architecture
- **Hero:** Growth-focused headlines with clear CTAs.
- **Strategy:** Replaces "About" to position Nathan as a strategic partner rather than just a worker.
- **Case Studies:** Resume items framed as solved problems with "Suggested Metrics" (TBD) to indicate high business intelligence.
- **Credentials:** Clear breakdown of technical stack and education.
